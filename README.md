A full-stack e-commerce app from scratch using React, GraphQL, Stripe, and the Headless CMS Strapi.

## Get Started

Open terminal.
Go to the root directory in the project file.
Go to the client directory.
`cd client`
Install all the dependencies by doing:
either:
`npm install or npm i`
or:
`yarn install or yarn i`
Run either `npm start` or `yarn start` depending on the method of installing the dependencies above.

By now, the `http://localhost:3000` should be up and running.
